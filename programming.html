        <h1>Introduction To Programming</h1>
<p>Encountering the term programming for the first time, might intimidate you and you might end up visualizing a person with a hoodie in a dark room kama wale hackers wa movies.
 Or view programmers as nerds who are only into issues related with technology. Mnawaitanga techies.</p>

<p>Well programming is not only for techies or hackers but rather a basic skill required to  survive in this technologically advancing world .
Kila mtu hutumia computer on a daily basis from as simple as the phone/laptop you are using to access this material to complex ones used to store
data in big organizations and therefore it is critical to understand that  computers have long  been used to solve most of our problems through programming.</p>

<p>So what is programming, programming is the process of writing computer programs. Which is, essentially giving the computer steps to follow in solving a particular problem or task.</p>

<p>Funny enough our mothers were the first ever programmers. Before atoke kwa nyumba alikuwa anaacha amekuambia akirudi apate vyombo zimeoshwa ,nyumba ni safi na umefua manguo.
Hizi zilikuwa steps zenye ziliensure you grew up to be a responsible person and also steps you had to follow to avoid a thorough beating. 
So just like our mothers we will be giving the computer steps to take in solving various problems</p>

<p>Primarily solving any problem through programming itaentail
    <ol>
<li>Reading data from the standard input(keyboard) or main memory(RAM)</li>
<li>Processing data to obtain  results</li>
<li>Output results to standard output (monitor)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Ikue unataka kudevelop an app,kufanya some arithmetics ama unataka kuautomate a repetitive task using your computer, program yoyote utaandika itaentail the steps tmemention above.
So how do we give the computer steps to follow na si aty unaeza iongelesha. We issue these steps using programming languages.</p>

<p>Programming languages are languages used by programmers to communicate to computers. 
As the name suggests izi ni languages and just like we have many natural languages is the same way we have various programming languages and not forgetting the same way  these languages have sets of rules on how to communicate is the 
same way our programming languages have rules called syntax which utakuja kuona are different from those of natural languages.</p> 

<p>Therefore as a programmer ukona a wide variety of programming languages to pick from depending on the type of problem you want to solve
They include python,java,ruby,kotlin,c,c++ and many others. At this point tshajua what is programming and what programming languages are, next we get to know how to use programming languages to communicate to computers.</p>

<p>First we have to understand that computers zinaunderstand states mbili pekee  on or off which when represented by binary digits are either 1 or 0. 1 for on and 0 for off. Let’s say we want to add two numbers. 
Using one of the languages stated ttapea our computer the following steps
 
<p>Steps in performing an addition.
<ol>
 <li>Take the first number </li>
<li>Take the second number </li>
<li>Add the two numbers </li>
<li>Display the result</li>
</ol>
</p>

 <p>But remember the computer only understands 1’s and 0’s so we will have to convert the above steps into 1’s and 0’s.
 Najua unajiuliza, sasa a language made up of words ita convertiwa aje ikuwe numbers ?</p>

<p>From here things will get pretty interesting so pay attention  if you really want to know programming.
What you need to know is that the steps tmeaandika ztakuwa stored in a file and will be referred to as a source code.
Regardless of which language you use the file is a source code. 
Ukiandika  in python programming language it is a python source code,if it is in java a java source code and so on.</p>

<p>When done writing your source code,it will go through a compiler. Compiler inatumikanga kucheck for errors, cause if you remember very well each language ikona a set of rules called syntax that must be followed.
After compiler imemake sure there are no errors in your source code file it will now convert your source code into 1' and 0's and store it in a file called object code.
The object code will then be run by the computer and your problem itakuwa solved since the computer can now understand the object code file which is in 1’s and 0’s. Hope its clear because these concepts are really important</p>

<h2>Production Of Results By Use Of Compilers And Computers</h2>

<p>Sorry ka hukua unapenda chem its just an example to make you understand the concepts better</p>

<p>We’ve now seen how our natural languages are converted to byte codes (1's and 0's) using a compiler 
Lets now summarize the process
<ol>
<li>We write our program using any language and store it in a file called source code</li>
<li>The source code goes through a Compiler which checks for errors before converting  our source code file into an object code file</li>
<li>The computer can now process/ run the object code file to produce results since it’s in 1's and 0's (byte code)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Sasa najua imestick,or is how ?</p>

<p>Juu ya hyo kazi yote ya kuelewa source code and object code let's now take a break and go on a trip along memory lane.</p>
