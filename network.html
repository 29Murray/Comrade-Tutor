<h1>Networking</h1>
<p>Ever wondered how the messages you send to your friends reach them. Ukifinya iyo send button uko sure that wherever he/she is will get your message. Yes even those risky texts.</p>
 
<p>With that welcome to networking where I explain how those risky texts and any other type of data is transferred from one computer to another through a network.
Na computer si lazma ikue those big desktop computers, even your phone is a small computer eeh ata hako katululu, basically anything that has a processor.</p>

<p>So lets first start with understanding what a computer network is. A computer network is a set of connected computers for the purpose of resource and data sharing  through various network media and  telecommunication technologies.
 Don’t get scared hii ni kizungu migi tu</p>

<p>Basically what this means is that if you were to start your own company today of supplying muratina utakuwa na offices za order taking, inventory updating and finally delivery.
So when your company receives an order inakuwa processed then sent to inventory for updating of the company’s stock and finally bottled and packaged for delivery.

What we see here is a flow of data/information within the same organization but different offices.
So tunahitaji kujua venye data itatoka from ofisi ya orders ipitie inventory hadi ifike delivery. So how do we do that ?
You’ve gussed it right we will have to connect the set of computers within our organization to create a network of computers for data and resource sharing.</p> 

<p>But again that’s not all lazma tena tujue how we will connect all these computers and if at all the company will grow and have branches how will these branches communicate to the main branch and also each other.
 For that we will use the various network media and telecommunication technologies.

Telecommunication inamaanisha communicating over long distances. So network media and telecommunication techs that allow for communication within the organization na pia branches will have to be implemented for again data and resource sharing.</p>

<h2>Network Media And Telecommunication Technologies </h2>
<p>For communication within the organization the computers can be connected physically  through network media cables such as coaxial,twisted pair ama fibre optic cables.

<p>For telecommunication tutatumia wireless networks such us wifi which means wireless fidelity, najua hukua unajua.</p>
<p>This is where things get interesting, so ile swali tikuwa tnajiuliza about the risky texts inajibiwa hapa so be keen.

So how is data transferred through wireless connectivity?
This is done through electromagnetic waves that can carry data signals from one point to another
Kaphysics kiasi, electromagnetic waves are invisible forms of energy that can travel over a specified range e.g radio waves,microwave,light and many others.</p>

<p>Try to imagine pond ikona maji,if a drop of water falls kwa hii pond the energy is transmitted equally in every direction.</p>

That's exactly how electromagnetic waves work. So someone discovered that they can be used to carry and transmit data over long distances (radio waves to be specific) and have since been used in wireless transfer of data
