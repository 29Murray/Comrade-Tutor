        <h1>Comrade Tutor</h1>
        
<p>Comrade tutor is a project aimed at simplifying the process of understanding various complex courses done in Kenyan universities. Nearly all information provided,
 in most of our universities, in terms of notes and lectures for the various courses being done is presented using intricate English.

This makes it hard for a majority of comrades to understand concepts within these materials. This is due to the simple fact that they first of all have to understand the foreign language used,
 which is at times a bit complicated, before understanding the concepts behind the language.</p>

<p>Comrade tutorâ€™s intention is to decipher such materials into ones that can easily be understood by any Kenyan youth. Using a combination of both English and Swahili the project has found a way of restructuring sentences. 
Where the subject and the verb within a sentence structure are written in Swahili where necessary but the object, which holds the main idea, is left in English.

Introduction of Swahili in most of our materials is purposed in creating a rapport with the reader and also reduce the strain of having first to understand the language being used. 
In doing so we  discovered that we were able to use examples the Kenyan youths could relate to, when explaining the concepts. 
This allows for better understanding and grasping of the concepts being read.</p> 

<p>To conclude, what we believe here at comrade tutor is that if as Kenya and Africa at large are able to understand things in our own way then it will pave way for implementing ideas and innovations in our own way, 
 giving rise to a whole revolution. Cause replacing certain words to Swahili for better understanding is the same way the same words can be converted to other African languages for the purpose of understanding. 
It has reached a time where as Africans we need to appreciate who we are and what we have.</p>
